Create (outside of a .cpp file), a text file with a sequence of 5 numbers. Create an integer array of size 5 within a .cpp file, open the text file, and then assign the array to the numbers within the file. Print the values in the array.

Once tha values are assined to the array,change the values within the array and override the values originally within the text file. Check the text file to see if the values have been overwritten.
