Create a file using {% ihighlight c++ %}ofstream{% endihighlight c++ %} and write a sequence of numbers (separated by a space), a newline, and a string. Then open that same file using {% ihighlight c++ %}ifstream{% endihighlight c++ %}, and read the file's contents into appropriate variables. Print the variables' values to ensure you have read from the file successfully. Clear the file when you are done with it.
